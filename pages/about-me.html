                        I really enjoy data and learning new skills. So being able to combine those two things would be amazing. 
                        There has been a fairly recent shift in how technology is embeded into roles and I've seen leaders beign more receptiive to the 'ordinary' person being apple to apply any skills they have to improve proceses (rather then sticky to traditional swimlanes of roles).
                        So I have started seeing the ability to immediately apply new skills, even if there are no specific roles available.

                        I am curently a Logistics Planner with BHP. The role offers a lot of flexibility and diversity of tasks meaning, despite beign in the role for over three years, I am still not bored. 
                        My key responsibility is to provide long term, strategic planning for all rail and port activities. 
                        The main aim is to ensure logistics is effective in providing certainty of production through enabling continued growth of coal production and enhacing competitive advantage through the supply chain.
                        My career aspirations are to continue advancing my analytical skills in roles that drive efficiency and productivity improvements through root cause analysis.

                        I am fortunate to have just recently build my first home, receving the keys shortly after the first 2020 lockdown.
                        I share the place with my 1 year old cavoodle, Mila.

                        After completely burning out during 2020, I've started focusing on a better work / life balance. My two key hobbies are:
